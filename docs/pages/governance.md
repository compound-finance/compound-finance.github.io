# Governance

Compound III is a decentralized protocol that is governed by holders and delegates of COMP. Governance allows the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative smart contract functions of the Compound III protocol. For more information on the Governor and Timelock see the original [governance](https://compound.finance/docs/governance) section.

All instances of Compound III are controlled by the Timelock contract which is the same administrator of the Compound v2 protocol. The governance system has control over each *proxy*, the *Configurator implementation*, the *Comet factory*, and the *Comet implementation*.

Each time an immutable parameter is set via governance proposal, a new Comet implementation must be deployed by the Comet factory. If the proposal is approved by the community, the proxy will point to the new implementation upon execution.

To set specific protocol parameters in a proposal, the Timelock must call all of the relevant set methods on the *Configurator* contract, followed by `deployAndUpgradeTo` on the *CometProxyAdmin* contract.

The following is an example of the liquidation factor's role in a Compound III liquidation:

An underwater account has supplied $100 of WBTC as collateral. If the WBTC liquidation factor is `0.9`, the user will receive $90 of the base asset when a liquidator triggers an absorption of their account.

This function sets the Comet contract's ERC-20 allowance of an asset for a manager address. It can only be called by the Governor.

In the event of a governance attack, an attacker could create a proposal that leverages this function to give themselves permissions to freely transfer all ERC-20 tokens out of the Comet contract.

Hypothetically, the attacker would need to either acquire supreme voting weight or add a malicious step in an otherwise innocuous and popular proposal and the community would fail to detect before approving.

```

* `manager`: The address of a manager account that has its allowance modified.
