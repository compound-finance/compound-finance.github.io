# Helper Functions

### Total Supply

The total supply of base tokens supplied to the protocol plus interest accrued to suppliers.

#### Comet

```solidity
function totalSupply() override external view returns (uint256)
```

* `RETURN`: The amount of base asset scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the base asset's contract.

#### Solidity

```solidity
Comet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);
uint256 totalSupply = comet.totalSupply();
```

#### Ethers.js v5.x

```js
const comet = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);
const totalSupply = await comet.callStatic.totalSupply();
```

### Total Borrow

The total amount of base tokens that are currently borrowed from the protocol plus interest accrued to all borrows.

#### Comet

```solidity
function totalBorrow() virtual external view returns (uint256)
```

* `RETURN`: The amount of base asset scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the base asset's contract.

#### Solidity

```solidity
Comet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);
uint256 totalBorrow = comet.totalBorrow();
```

#### Ethers.js v5.x

```js
const comet = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);
const totalBorrow = await comet.callStatic.totalBorrow();
```

### Total Collateral

The protocol tracks the current amount of collateral that all accounts have supplied. Each valid collateral asset sum is tracked in a mapping with the asset address that points to a struct.

#### Comet

```solidity
struct TotalsCollateral {
    uint128 totalSupplyAsset;
    uint128 _reserved;
}

mapping(address => TotalsCollateral) public totalsCollateral;
```

* `address`:  The address of the collateral asset's contract.
* `RETURN`: A struct containing the stored data pertaining to the sum of the collateral in the protocol.
* `totalSupplyAsset`: A Solidity `uint128` of the sum of the collateral asset stored in the protocol, scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the asset's contract.

#### Solidity

```solidity
Comet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);
TotalsCollateral totalsCollateral = comet.totalsCollateral(0xERC20Address);
```

#### Ethers.js v5.x

```js
const comet = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);
const [ totalSupplyAsset ] = await comet.callStatic.totalsCollateral('0xERC20Address');
```

### Supplied Base Balance

This function returns the current balance of base asset for a specified account in the protocol, including interest. If the account is presently borrowing or not supplying, it will return `0`.

#### Comet

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```

* `account`: The address of the account in which to retrieve the base asset balance.
* `RETURNS`: The balance of the base asset, including interest, in the protocol for the specified account as an unsigned integer scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the asset's contract.

#### Solidity

```solidity
Comet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);
uint balance = comet.balanceOf(0xAccount);

const comet = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);
const balance = await comet.callStatic.balanceOf('0xAccount');
```

### Borrow Balance

This function returns the current balance of borrowed base asset for a specified account in the protocol, including interest. If the account has a non-negative base asset balance, it will return `0`.

#### Comet

```solidity
function borrowBalanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```

* `account`: The address of the account in which to retrieve the borrowed base asset balance.
* `RETURNS`: The balance of the base asset, including interest, borrowed by the specified account as an unsigned integer scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the asset's contract.

const owed = await comet.callStatic.borrowBalanceOf('0xAccount');
```

### Base Balance as Integer

```

* `account`: The address of the account in which to retrieve the base asset balance.
* `RETURNS`: The balance of the base asset, including interest, that the specified account is due as an unsigned integer scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the asset's contract.

const comet = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);
const baseBalance = await comet.callStatic.baseBalanceOf('0xAccount');
```

### Account Data

The protocol tracks data like the principal and indexes for each account that supplies and borrows. The data is stored in a mapping with the account address that points to a struct.

#### Comet

```solidity
struct UserBasic {
    int104 principal;
    uint64 baseTrackingIndex;
    uint64 baseTrackingAccrued;

  * Supplying of a collateral asset and borrowing of the base asset.
  * Supplying or withdrawing of the native EVM token (like Ether) directly.
  * Transferring or withdrawing of the base asset without leaving dust in the account.

### Invoke

#### Bulker

```solidity
uint public constant ACTION_SUPPLY_ASSET = 1;
uint public constant ACTION_SUPPLY_ETH = 2;
uint public constant ACTION_TRANSFER_ASSET = 3;
uint public constant ACTION_WITHDRAW_ASSET = 4;
uint public constant ACTION_WITHDRAW_ETH = 5;

function invoke(uint[] calldata actions, bytes[] calldata data) external payable

    * `amount`: The amount of the native token as an unsigned integer scaled up by 10 to the number of decimals of precision of the native EVM token.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

#### Solidity

```solidity
Bulker bulker = Bulker(0xBulkerAddress);
// ERC-20 `approve` the bulker. Then Comet `allow` the bulker to be a manager before calling `invoke`.
bytes memory supplyAssetCalldata = (abi.encode('0xAccount', '0xAsset', amount);
bulker.invoke([ 1 ], [ supplyAssetCalldata ]);
```

#### Ethers.js v5.x

```js
const bulker = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);

const supplyAssetCalldata = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(['address', 'address', 'uint'], ['0xAccount', '0xAsset', amount]);
await bulker.invoke([ 1 ], [ supplyAssetCalldata ]);
```
