# Compound API

## Introduction

The Compound API input and output formats are specified by [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/){:target="_blank"}, known colloquially as protobufs. Unlike typical protobufs endpoints, the Compound endpoints support JSON for input and output in addition to the protobufs binary format. To use JSON in both the input and the output, specify the headers `"Content-Type: application/json"` and `"Accept: application/json"` in the request.

The Compound API no longer supports the Ethereum testnets.

It is a possibility that in the future, API keys will be required to access the API.

## AccountService
{:id='account-service'}

The Account API retrieves information for various accounts which have interacted with Compound. You can use this API to pull data about a specific account by address, or alternatively, pull data for a list of unhealthy accounts (that is, accounts which are approaching under-collateralization).

```js
// Retreives list of accounts and related supply and borrow balances.
fetch("https://api.compound.finance/api/v2/account");

// Returns details for given account
fetch("https://api.compound.finance/api/v2/account?addresses[]=0x00..");
```

#### GET: `/account`

#### AccountRequest

The request to the account API can specify a number filters, such as which addresses to retrieve information about or general health requirements. The following shows an example set of request parameters in JSON:

```js
{
  "addresses": [] // returns all accounts if empty or not included
  "block_number": 0 // returns latest if given 0
  "max_health": { "value": "10.0" }
  "min_borrow_value_in_eth": { "value": "0.002" }
  "page_number": 1
  "page_size": 10
